# Morse Typing Trainer for Gboard
This is a fork of [googlecreativelab/morse-learn](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/morse-learn)

I've forked Google Creative's Lab original work to have it running on **desktop**, and detect keyboard strokes as it were a single button (dih is a short press on any key, dah is a longer press on any key).

Android custom keyboard is **not needed** here.

Using parcel for bundling, much speedier.

## Usage
```
yarn; // install dependencies
yarn start; // start the local budo webserver
```
